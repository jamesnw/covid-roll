	<p class="text-sm"><strong>Positive Percent:</strong> The data going into Positive Percent is fairly problematic, with tests being reported for day administered, and results being reported for day returned. A guess at the margin of error is probably +/- 5%, so it's probably only useful for seeing if we're anywhere close to a goal of 5%. It may be useful in comparing counties, or seeing how a county compares to the state. Testing delays will likely show up here as dips and rises.</p>
